        <p>My first week was hot, busy and all together, a lot of fun. Food is of course not clearly marked here so I have unfortunatley been restricted in what I can eat. As a temporary solution, I have started off by cooking more myself, and I am feeling healthier already. So it’s not so bad to be a kosher kid down under.</p>
<p>Rush week is more of a “rush day”, and most students are in fact already living locally, not in dorms. While there were way too many tents to get through in one day, and while the only honor society was “golden key” (seemed far too readily willing to accept members for money, without requiring a GPA). There was even a Jewish society! I was instantly homesick 😭 🇮🇱 It turns out that “college” here means the last two years of high school, and that college is really called “uni”. Foolishly, I thought materials were optional, or to be provided. All up, it was going to cost over $400 Australian Dollars! <em>Oy.</em> I bought old editions and will try to copy from my desk-partners. Luckily I’m not a freshman, so I know that CS cannot have changed that much in a year.</p>
