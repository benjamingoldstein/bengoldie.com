        <p>I was fascinated by the appearance of the first colorful electric scooter.</p>
<p>I was annoyed at their insane spread over the city.</p>
<p>I was resigned to acceptance by the appearance of a THIRD (3RD!) escooter brand in the country.</p>
<p>But this is nothing compared to how I felt when I first rode one: It was smooth, it was fun, it was FAST, it was only a few shekels. And as an added bonus, it was (supposedly) environmentally friendly. Call me an environmentalist and throw me in a Kibbutz, but I beleive I am definitely on ‚Äúteam e-scooter‚Äù. I wish I had used one months ago. Now if only they needed a programmer to intern for them‚Ä¶</p>
<p>For my Australian relatives, you can learn about the scooter craze here. It probably hasn‚Äôt reached the sandy beaches of St Kilda yet.</p>

<p><em>Note this is just the top link that I googled, I only watched half of it, but the content and quality of bloomberg is quite high so this is likley to be kosher.</em></p>
<p>Enjoy it! üõ¥</p>
