        <p>It seems as though every coworking space in Tel Aviv (at least, in this gap year), has become completely filled with Vue / Angular / React fans. Like all gold rushes, there is a lot less gold and a lot more carts and picks sold. I know that many of the front-end JS development tools are used when they don’t need to be, though I do agree, it is so much more enjoyable to learn these new tools first, and then run paid side projects in them.</p>
<p>I even ended up suggesting a SPA JS solution for a contracting jig for a family friend. It wasn’t the most complicated site, having hardly any functionality, but ultimately it did the job, and they were happy with the look. I am not big on aesthetics, so I feel that much of the heavy lifting was done for me.</p>
<p>If you would like to hire me for your next website or programming job, whether you’re a part of the JS SPA gold rush, or just looking for a normal HTML developer, then do email me at the link above.</p>
