        <p>I recently became involved with a student club committee, seemingly but not actually, to help with their books and finance (Treasurer seems to befit me, I’ve always ended up as the financial controller of my soccer club in my childhood neighborhood, and so on), but the real reason was to become closer friends with one of the english-major types that caught my eye. Yesh! As my good luck would have it, she took interst in me and it’s my first time dating in college!</p>
<p>As it happens, my level of experience with the finances was no doubt impressive to the remainder of the committee (who are unbiased by my looks I think it is safe to assume) such that I am staying on to help with their spreadsheets and other book keeping duties. A small cost to pay for meeting a beautiful girl. Now I am on the committee, pizootz!</p>
