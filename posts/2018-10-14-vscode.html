        <p>The first thing I noticed was that UTF-8 is suppored right out of the box.</p>
<p>If you are editing a plain text file, and want to write in Hebrew, then in VSCode in the bar near the bottom, find the label UTF-8. It opens a popup, do ‘Save with encoding’. You can now pick a new encoding, chose one that works with Hebrew.</p>
<p>Open your <code>settings.json</code> by hitting Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and then typing “sett..” until it shows up. I started my base configuration as the default, and then I wrote some custom PowerShell scripts to make RTL content easier to wrangle. I’m all set up and ready to get back into my project work! I give thanks for this ability, and for the עוֹשֶׁר wealth that paid side projects have given me.</p>
