        <p>I was re-watching Microsoft’s connect() i.e. Developer Conference, from last year and as I watched, I mused that, no-one else has had this much impact on the people of this earth (wherever they come from). Microsoft is no longer “also” doing cloud and AI, they are doing it, and they just keep winning at it.</p>
<p>My Windows Phone was one of my earliest computing devices, treasured. And having to retire it has brought me some sadness. I had it since 2015 and used it for less anf less, but I strongly miss many aspects. I am nostalgic today, and I wish it hadn’t failed. But new software is king, so I will adopt it and learn.</p>
