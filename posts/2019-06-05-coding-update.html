        <p>Fear not dear readers, you thought <em>“A girlfriend! This is the end of the coding days”</em>. Certainly so feared I! But to the contrary, I have since mastered the Monad, in my own spare time, without any official coursework towards it. With great jealousy I have discovered there is very little content of functional programming at my college, and yet other Universities have full courses on it (albeit later year courses).</p>
<p>In any case, as I have reaped such enjoyment, here are the summaries of why you should learn and use the Monad, even though you will not acheive better marks in your university programming courses:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It makes you a better programmer</p></li>
<li><p>It expands your mind. When you are strugling to understand someone’s code, and all of your being desires to throw it’s hands up, then you know this is your mind being expanded.</p></li>
<li><p>Enjoyment of your work feeds your soul. There is no work more enjoyable than learning.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I hope to find a use for my newly learned functional programming skills.</p>
