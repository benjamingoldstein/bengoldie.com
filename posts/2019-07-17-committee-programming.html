        <p>In order to make my committee treasurer duties less tiring and tedious, and to avoid 2 hours of mindless copy pasting, I have written a small application that uses monadic IO with the TensorFlow machine learning library, “reading” numbers out of PDF bank statements, so that I do not have to manually retype the committee’s banking records into a excel spreadsheet. I know what you are thinking, couldn’t you just copy paste them? Well, no the text that gets selected gets all wrapped the wrong way and some characters are just plain not copied out of the PDF.</p>
<p>I ran into many many issues setting up the environment, and I demand an answer: <em>Why do so few haskellers use windows? Why can the people not have instructions for non-unix systems!?</em></p>
<p>Microsoft ranting aside, I managed to configure the library on my (windows) dorm desktop. It took several hours to build and debug (so far), and it is far less accurate than simply using the eyes that God gave me, but I am intellectually stimulated, and my position as treasurer remains useful to the rest of the committee.</p>
<p>Here, the pleasure is being on the committee, and the fun(!) is the coding. I have many more ideas about how I can help the committee as treasurer with my coding talent. Stay tuned! Now, if only my university assignments were as interesting.</p>
