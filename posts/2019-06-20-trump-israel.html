        <p>This will be my only political blog post for a while.</p>
<p>One of my friends pointed out why I was in support of the outrageous Trump‚Äôs actions in Israel. They‚Äôre not that close of a friend so I realised the need to clarify myself.</p>
<p>I am obviously pleased with recognition of Israel as a state, and the movement of the US embassy to Jerusalem and the support of the whitehouse for the general struggle of my people. But I do agree with my friend, the concern is real, WHY does Trump not speak out against the racists and other unnamed trouble makers? It would be only so easy for him to step into the light and declare his allegiance to the people, and reject the so called ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù. But he does not?</p>
<p>I can only assume he is as stupid as he looks, which is to say, very. However, I do support his singular action in Jerusalem with the embassy. üáÆüá±</p>
<p>Outside of his attitude towards Israel, Trump is an idiot.</p>
