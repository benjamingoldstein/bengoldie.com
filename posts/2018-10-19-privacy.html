        <p>Privacy is important to all of us in this day. So therefore, it’s important to use a Proxy or VPN to hide your IP address, they are cheap and easy to set up. But why do you need one? If you are doing anything that is morally agreeably under the Halakha but happens to be illegal (perhaps you are in China), do make sure to not do it from your own house, or use a VPN! You can find many resources and popular VPN services</p>
<p>Some other Privacy tips: * Don’t share personal details on social media, because you cannot simply take them down. * Have a main email addy, and have a throw-away email addy, so that you can register for services without giving away your real email. Then all the newsletters and nonsense will be sent to the throw-away email addy. * Remember not to take any photographs on your mobile device that you may not want to be be backed up to The Cloud. Or, turn such features off, as I have done.</p>
