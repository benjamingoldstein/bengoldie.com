        <p>Privacy is important.</p>
<p>This blog post is about how to protect your information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are buying a domain (a “.com” website) be sure to google “How to protect your domain info”. Even if it’s a personal blog like mine.</p></li>
<li><p>Use WhatsApp, which is encrypted end-to-end for your personal messages (again, just because you have something to hide, doesn’t mean you’re a criminal! My girlfriend and I would be mortified if our personal messages were put up on the internet)</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you use a proxy or VPN service. It’s not like in the movies, you just need a normal VPN for a few dollars a month.</p></li>
<li><p>Use passwords on your devices, not simple PINs.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re from the US, make sure you vote on issues like net neutrality, and support a free and open internet.</p></li>
<li><p>You can find out more at <a href="https://eff.org">EFF</a></p></li>
<li><p>Don’t put photos of yourself online, because soon facial recognition will become everywhere. This may sound scaremongering, but companies and The Bad Guys will be able to track you, even if you have GPS on your Windows phone / Android / iOS device turned off.</p></li>
</ul>
